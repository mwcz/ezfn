Put a bunch of functions in the global namespace to make them easy to call.

Pollute the global namespace! Namespacing is a honking bad idea, let's do less of that!

Inspiration
-----------

[p5](https://p5js.org/) is the main inspiration.  p5 is wonderfully approachable, in large part because every function is in the global namespace.

I wanted to preserve that, while also using p5 in an ES module.

Obviously, namespacing is a good idea.
